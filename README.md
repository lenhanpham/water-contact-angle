# Code used to calculate contact angles 

This is a piece of python code used to determine contact angles of a droplet on a surface. A 2D number-density map from Gromacs MD simulations is in need. This piece of code was written by Le Nhan Pham, a postdoctoral research fellow at Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) - Deakin University. This code is a part of a project with the aim to develop a new MD force field for simulation of biological molecules adsorbed on the MoS<sub>2</sub> surface. The code is self-explanatory.
