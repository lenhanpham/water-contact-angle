Python code use to find out contact angle of a droplet on the surface. A 2D number-density map from Gromacs MD simulations is in need. This piece of code was done by Le Nhan Pham, a postdoctoral research fellow at Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) - Deakin University. This code is a part of a project with the aim to develop a new MD force field for simulation of biological molecules adsorbed the MoS2 surface. 

If you use this code, please cite the following paper. (will be updated soon)
